# Student Grades Analysis

This Python script analyzes student grades from a CSV file and provides insights into their performance across various subjects and semesters. The script includes functions to identify failing students, calculate average grades, determine the hardest subject, and visualize the results using bar and line plots.

## Key Functionalities
    The analysis encompasses several core functionalities, including:
- Identifying Failing Students: The system retrieves and lists students who have not passed at least one subject, defined as having a score below 50.
- Calculating Average Grades: The project computes and displays the average grade for each subject across all students, providing a clear view of overall performance in each subject.
- Determining Top Performers: It identifies and prints the student(s) with the highest average grade across all subjects, showcasing academic excellence.
- Finding the Hardest Subject: The analysis determines which subject has the lowest average grade, highlighting potential challenges in that area.
- Creating a New DataFrame: The project generates a new DataFrame containing average grades by semester for each subject and saves this data to an Excel file for further analysis.

## Technical Stack
    This project is implemented using the following technologies:
- Python: The primary programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Pandas: Utilized for data handling and analysis, enabling efficient operations on data frames.
- Matplotlib: Used for visualizing the results through graphs, including bar and line plots to represent average grades.
